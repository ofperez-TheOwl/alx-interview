# **Pascal's Triangle**

## **Description**

It is an array of integer with a triangular form in which each integer is the addition of the integers that are above it (reading from left to right and considering a blank entry as 0). The very first entry is 1.
I will use a recursive functions to generate the lists that will form the arry.
