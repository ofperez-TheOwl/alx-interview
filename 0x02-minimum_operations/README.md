# **Pascal's Triangle**

## **Description**

In a text file, there is a single character `H`. Your text editor can execute only two operations in this file: `Copy All` and `Paste`.
Given a number `n`, write a method that calculates the fewest number of operations needed to result in exactly `n` `H` characters in the file.

I will use a recursive function to calculate `n`.
